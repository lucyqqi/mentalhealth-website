     <p class = "introtext">The following are some ways that digital technology can improve an individual’s mental health and well-being.</p>

     <p class = "headerpink">Decrease depression by entertainment</p>
     <p class = "text">With moderation, studies had found that teenagers who experienced depression saw fewer symptoms when they spent a limited amount of time watching television shows on their screens. Entertainment, such as Netflix, movies, and anime, can be distracting and appealing, helping simulate young teens’ imagination. Thus, using screens for entertainment can alleviate negative thinking patterns and allow adolescents to escape distressing emotions. However, this entertainment time should be limited and not interfere with daily routines in life.</p>

     <p class = "headerpink">Less psychosocial stress for adults</p>
     <p class = "text">Adults who use social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, experienced less psychological stress than other adults who did not utilize social media. Social media in moderation allows adults to connect with family members and friends far away, decreasing negative feelings that arise from a lack of relationships in adulthood. </p>

     <p class = "headerpink">Decrease stress by making busy work easier</p>
     <p class = "text">Screens have also improved individuals’ lives, making busy work easier. Rather than going to buy something, people can use the Internet and services such as Amazon to have these items delivered instantly. These items may include daily errands such as groceries and recurring orders for house supplies. In addition, there are excellent productivity tools that can better schedule an individual’s days and send out reminders, helping organize one’s life. By using beneficial platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion, digital technology can decrease stress and make life more enjoyable for everyone. </p>

     <p class = "headerpink">Increase perceptions of self-efficacy</p>
     <p class = "text">Many computer users feel accomplished when they learn a new technology skill. Devices have an extensive array of resources to help individuals learn new hardware or software, helping improve mental well-being as they feel more competent, knowing they can handle tasks independently.</p>

     <p class = "headerpink">Expanded community</p>
     <p class = "text">When people use their devices to play video and communal games, they experience a better sense of community. Multiplayer games allow individuals to connect with others globally, providing social and emotional benefits, as they can bond over a shared interest (i.e., the game) and interact with one another. In addition, individuals can feel more connected on social media because human interaction occurs on those sites, although not always face-to-face.</p>
