  <p class = "normal">Technology is supposed to bring people together, but unfortunately, it has contributed to adverse effects on mental health. Research has indicated that internet addiction is becoming a widespread problem, especially among younger demographics. Overall, it suggests that a higher level of screen time is associated with reduced physical activity, lower well-being, and increased risk of depression.

          <h3>Cyberbullying and Sexting</h3>
          <p>Cyberbullying is a severe concern online. Studies show that more than 50% of all 10-18 year-olds have experienced some cyberbullying in their lifetime. The longer young people connect with strangers and peers online, the higher the risk of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying can have a strong negative impact on well-being, including feelings of suicide. Along with cyberbullying, sexting is also another possible risk teens may be exposed to, which is the act of  sending sexual text messages. As a matter of fact, 39% of teens admitted to sending sext messages, and also half of all teenagers received texts that had nudity in them.</p>
        </div>
        <div style = "flex: 1">
        <h3>Depression and Anxiety</h3>
        <p>A study in 2017 found that excessive use of digital devices increased depression in users. Teens and adults who spent time looking at their screen for more than six hours a day were more likely to experience moderate to severe depression than those who spent less time on their screens due to a level of disconnectedness. Furthermore, spending excessive time on a screen can increase feelings of isolation and interrupt genuine real-life connections. A lack of real human relationships and shallow “friends” in social networks can contribute to depression. Their attempts to soothe their depression with screen time —such as passive use of social media sites— produce a vicious cycle, further amplifying the depression.

        </div>
        <div style = "flex:1">
        <h3>Low Self-Confidence</h3>
        <p>Individuals who spend excessive time on social media may also have lower self-esteem because they compare themselves to peers on the platforms. In fact, higher use of social media makes people three times more likely to have perceived social isolation. Social media users compare themselves to friends, family, celebrities, and influencers on the platform, which can be detrimental to their mental health. They’re comparing their current state with someone’s existence that appears picture-perfect. Consequently, low-self esteem may lead to body image issues and negative self-talk. As when people get on social media, they are looking for affirmation, consciously or not, while also comparing their lives to others, so they forget to enjoy the current moment.</p>

          <h3>Poor Posture</h3>
          <p>Individuals’ use of mobile devices may contribute to incorrect posture, leading to musculoskeletal issues over time. Many technologies promote a “down and forward” user position, which means the person is hunched forward, looking at the screen. This may put an additional amount of pressure on the neck and spine. In fact, in the Journal Applied Ergonomics, a 5-year study found an association between upper back pain in young adults and texting. </p>
        </div>
        <div style = "flex: 1">
        <h3>Sleep Problems</h3>
        <p>Too much screen time has been shown to impact sleep negatively, as the time spent staring at a screen’s blue light can interfere with circadian rhythms and cause eyestrain. Bright lights from mobile devices block melatonin secretion, which is the hormone that regulates sleep. Problematically, 90% of Americans used electronics several nights per week within 1 hour before bedtime. Moreover, the repetitive use of a bright screen can delay circadian rhythms by 1.5 hours, contributing to anxiety and acting out. In addition, not getting enough sleep can lead to other effects, such as increased feelings of depression.

        </div>
        <div style = "flex:1">
        <h3>Reduced Physical Activity</h3>
        <p>The more time people sit and use their screens, the less time they generally exercise because technology interrupts daily activities. Exercise can improve mental health significantly because it can ameliorate depression, reduce anxiety, improve sleep quality, and enhance self-esteem. Consequently, when screen time interferes with exercise, it promotes a sedentary lifestyle that may have long-term mental and physical health risks, such as premature death and cardiovascular disease. In fact, approximately 3.2 million deaths per year are due to physical inactivity. </p>

<p class="normal">These physical and psychological issues mentioned above, are just a few of the many impacts digital technology has on our society. Even people from Mr. Anthony’s very own computer science class experience the detrimental effects of technology as well. Hear about technology’s impact on mental health from fellow students:</p>
