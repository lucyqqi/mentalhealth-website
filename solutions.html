     <p class = "introtext">Significantly limiting people’s usage of devices today would be nearly impossible and prevent society from deriving technology’s benefits. Thus, the best way to ensure that screen time doesn’t affect mental health is by using devices correctly and being aware of the time spent looking at screens. Here are some suggestions to minimize the adverse effect of screen time on well-being.</p>

     <p class = "headerpink">The 20-20-20 rule for digital viewing</p>
     <p class = "text">When using any form of technology for long periods, the American Optometrist Association recommends the 20-20-20 rule. To use the rule, after every 20 minutes of screen time, take a 20-second break to look at something at least 20 feet away. Doing this may help reduce eye strain, headaches and improve sleep quality. In general, scheduling time to unplug can help ensure individuals connect with loved ones and everyone’s eyes and brains are taking a break from staring at digital screens. </p>

     <p class = "headerpink">Balance screen time with extracurriculars and hobbies</p>
     <p class = "text">Especially for teenagers, extracurriculars are extremely important, as they help prevent them from using their phones. Therefore, parents should sign their teens up for a moderate number of extracurricular activities, as studies show teens who do more extracurriculars (and have less screen time) have the best mental health outcomes. Therefore, parents can help them foster human connections by assisting them in finding extracurriculars they enjoy. As well, for parents and adults themselves, they should find enjoyable and fulfilling hobbies to help them keep away from the screen.

     <p class = "headerpink">Schedule time to move</p>
     <p class = "text">Balance screen time by moving around as well. People can exercise by going on a run, walking, or anything that gets them moving—even just walking through a mall. Especially as an adult, scheduling activities to ensure one receives enough movement improves one's health and naturally brings them away from the screen and virtual world.  </p>

     <p class = "headerpink">Big data collection opportunity</p>
     <p class = "text">Technology has the fantastic ability to collect objective information about the behaviour in the context of lives, generating rich data that can help with the mental health needs of individuals. By building apps that can track digital exhaust, researchers can gain insights into well-established behavioral aspects, such as the building blocks of mental health. Consequently, this information can empower individuals by giving them actionable insights into patterns of behaviour they may not have discerned.  </p>
     <p class = "text">Data on these patterns can alert people regarding the need for self-management before these issues escalate further. For example, self-management apps allow individuals to use specific information to receive feedback on managing stress and tension or remind them to take their medications. Since teens usually are most vulnerable to these risks and burdens, these mental-health prevention and treatment opportunities —capitalized from data-collecting functions and the Internet— may help achieve breakthroughs in improving this mental health epidemic. </p>
